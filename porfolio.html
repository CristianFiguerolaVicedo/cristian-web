Normally this type of pages sacrifice style for information and I think that you can combine both of them, a wiki can be useful and beautifull at the same time. And in that thought this idea came to my head. <br><br> This app, as most of the ones I make it's made using Springboot for the backend and React for the frontend.</p>
