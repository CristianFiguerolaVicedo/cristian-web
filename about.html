                    <p class="text-xl pt-3 animate-from-top delay-5">Outside of coding, I try to be disciplined, organized and consisten, things that reflect on my coding skills later. I always try to keep a positive attitude towards life, something that also helps me cope with frustration, something quite common in this profession. I am also a defender of mental health as something important, so I also try to keep balance between obligations and free time.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-4xl desc-text animate-from-top delay-4">Outside web development.</h1>
                    <p class="text-xl pt-3 animate-from-top delay-5">Aside from my passion for web development I do other things to keep my mind and body healthy and peaceful. One of my passions is going to the gym, as this helps me phisically and mentally and gives me a moment to clear my mind and come back to solve problems in a more calm way or with another point of view. I also appreciate time for doing things I like and rest doing things such as meeting with friends. Another one of my hobbies is playing videogames, alone or with people.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-4xl desc-text animate-from-top delay-4">Professional landscape.</h1>
                    <p class="text-xl pt-3 animate-from-top delay-5">As a junior web developer, I became fascinated by frontend technologies such as React and Vue. But I also like working with databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL and backend technologies such as Springboot and Node.js</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-white text-start max-w-4xl">
                    <h1 class="text-4xl desc-text animate-from-top delay-4">Techonology enthusiast.</h1>
                    <p class="text-xl pt-3 animate-from-top delay-5">Developing webs is the main thing but not the only one I'm interested in. I also like investigating about cybersecurity and how to identify and neutralize online threats. Also, I find quite important to be aware of the most cutting-edge technologies, so I try to investigate and learn as much as I can about AI's and machine learning.</p>

                <div class="text-white text-start max-w-4xl">
                    <h1 class="text-4xl desc-text animate-from-top delay-4">Integration of human mind and technology.</h1>
                    <p class="text-xl pt-3 animate-from-top delay-5">As I said before, I am so intriged by the human mind and I'm a firm defender of mental health and its importance, so when I code I always try to have in mind good practices to keep a good mental health. Things like not coding to exhaustion, doing some rest, rest my eyes when coding for long hours and many more things to ensure that I can work at my best conditions, something that gets reflected in my work</p>
